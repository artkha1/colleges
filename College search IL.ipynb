    "The next cell is a custom scoring system. Explanation (footnotes are in the code below):\n",
    "1. Values used in the deviation section are of the perfect university - the more a value deviates from these, the worse. Columns are built with ABSOLUTE deviation from the ideal value for those features, e.g. the perfect admission rate would be 65% (not too high, not too low). Absolute deviation = |x-preferred_value|. Later these deviations will be normalized - those that are far away from the ideal/desired value will be high on a 0 to 100 scale, and those that are close to ideal will be low. Thus, we'd like to minimize this deviation, so we subtract it from the overall score. Higher deviations = lower score. Perfectly fits the criteria = deviation of 0, so nothing gets subtracted from the score. NOTE: normally, the optimal or \"ideal\" values would be computed through extensive research, formulas, and algorithms. Oftentimes optimal values ar either the mean or the median. However, as this project's \"optimal values\" are just my ideas of what a good college would look like for ME, they are completely subjective. These values are just what I personally would like to see in my university.\n",
    "2. We now standardize *all* values on a 0-100 scale. To do this, the [min-max normalization/feature scaling technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling#Methods) is utilized. It shows how each university compares to other universities - a value closer to 100 means that particular feature is higher than most other counterparts'. We will want some features (like salary) maximized, and some (like cost and deviation from perfection) minimized. The score is calculated by adding all the standardized features that need to be maximized. From this score, we then subtract the sum of all the standardized features that need to be minimized. If a value is NaN, it becomes 0 or 100 depending on whether it needs to be minimized or maximized. NaN + or - any number will be NaN, but by filling NaNs we ensure that no college will receive a score of NaN, however they are still going to have a disadvantage compared to the colleges without any NaNs. While adding and subtracting, we also multiply all the values by a specific weight - a value from 0 to 1 where 0 is \"completely unimportant\" and 1 is \"extremely important.\"  So, a value that's less important (like the number of students) will have less impact on the score than an extremely important feature such as percentage of students in computer science or the overall cost of attendance. NOTE: again, weights are determined subjectively based on how relatively important certain features are to ME. Normally, the weights would be determined by a consensus of data scientists, often with the use of research and analysis. In this system, an absolutely ideal college that has a 100 in every \"good feature\" and a 0 in every \"bad\" feature will get 500 points: 100\\*1+100\\*0.6+100\\*0.8+100\\*0.6+100\\*0.9+100\\*0.4+100\\*0.7-0 = 500\n",
    "3. Instead of absolute deviation, standard deviation/z-score could've been used: \n",
    "\n",
    "    `toNorm.apply(lambda x: (x-x.mean())/x.std(ddof=0))`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    However, in this method, the more the value deviates from the mean, the worse. For most features, that would be a good idea, but that would not work with some of the deviation features. For instance, the mean % female in Illinois colleges is 60%, whereas my ideal value is 50%. With the z-score technique, a college with 50% females would get a lower z-score than a college with 60%. So, logically, this feature needs to be minimized (lower score = better), however, there's another issue - a percentage that's too low is bad as well. So, the mean in a lot of cases doesn't correspond to my preferred values. Another example is % computer science students - the mean in the state is 2, so a college with 20% comp sci students will get a high z score as it is far away from the mean. So, again, if this is the case, then high z score for % comp sci students should be good, right? But a college with 97% comp sci students would not be a good fit either. So z-score is not well suited for this project. The only way to calculate deviations is see how much each value deviates not from the mean, but from my preference."
